# ACSC Hardening Guides GPO Exports 

-------------------

This repo is a GPO export of the ACSC Hardening Guides for Win10/11 and Office 365. <br>
Microsoft provides settings catalog imports for Intune managed devices, but there isn't anything for on-prem things.

Based of the 16-Jul-24 version of the Windows 10/11 Hardening Guide - https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-microsoft-windows-10-and-windows-11-workstations <br>
and 24-Jul-23 verision of Office 365, 2021, 2019 and 2016 Hardening Guide - https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-hardening/hardening-microsoft-365-office-2021-office-2019-and-office-2016 <br>

Probably meant to be used in conjuction with the Microsoft Security Baselines - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/microsoftsecurityandcompliance/blog/microsoft-security-baselines

Blah blah blah no warranties, do testing, etc etc <br>
I did this so you hopefully didn't have to.
